# Robots Analysis for the Daily Pennsylvanian

The Daily Pennsylvanian's `robots.txt` file is available at
[https://www.thedp.com/robots.txt](https://www.thedp.com/robots.txt).

## Contents of the `robots.txt` file on [ ... date you accessed the file ... ]

```
User-agent: *
Crawl-delay: 10
Allow: /

User-agent: SemrushBot
Disallow: /
```

## Explanation

Interpretation
This robots.txt file contains instructions for web crawlers and bots about how they should interact with the website:
For all crawlers (User-agent: *):

Crawl-delay: 10 - All crawlers should wait 10 seconds between requests to reduce server load
Allow: / - All crawlers are permitted to access the entire website

For SemrushBot specifically (User-agent: SemrushBot):

Disallow: / - SemrushBot is explicitly prohibited from crawling any part of the website

Implications for Scraping
If you're using a general web scraper (not SemrushBot), you are allowed to access all parts of the website, but you must respect the 10-second delay between requests. This rate limiting is intended to prevent your scraper from overwhelming the server.
If you're using SemrushBot or a tool that identifies itself as SemrushBot, you should not scrape this website at all, as it's explicitly blocked.
Remember that while robots.txt provides guidelines, it operates on an honor system. The website relies on crawlers to voluntarily follow these rules, and ignoring them could potentially lead to your IP being blocked by the website.
